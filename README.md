# ESP8266-WiFi-Client-Server-Base64-Communication
This project demonstrates a simple WiFi-based client-server communication system using two ESP8266 microcontrollers. The client sends a base64-encoded message via HTTP POST to the server every 5 seconds. The server receives, decodes the message, and sends back an acknowledgment.
